### The results of the game is show underneath the gaming-area and is easy to read.

## **Features left to implement**
### There are a few things I would like to add to the game when time allows. I would like for the user to be able to add their own name as player. I would also add a specific number of turns for each game. As it is there are infinite goes so user can just keep on playing until he/her wins.

## **Tests done**
### -The game works well on different browsers as Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
### -I have tested and confirmed the game is responsive on different screen sizes and works well on iPhone SE, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, iPad Air and other standard models.
### - I have confirmed that colors an choosen font is easy to read.

### When run through the official W3C Validator it shows the h1 element as an empty heading wich could be because the heading changes constantly due to the code in javascript.
